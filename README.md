## About me
First year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, Department of Biomedical Engineering. Advised by [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/) (primary) and [Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/). Working on projects related to multimodal modeling of irregularly sampled clinical time series data, pre-surgical risk stratification with ECG (with [Robert Stevens](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu/about_us.html)), and conformal prediction of healthcare outcomes (with [Prasanna Santhanam](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/prasanna-santhanam)).

## Previously

I spent two years as a postbaccalaureate IRTA at the National Institutes of Mental Health, in the [Data Science and Sharing Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) and [Machine Learning Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt). I worked applied projects realted to machine learning to healthcare and neuroscience. In particular:

* **[Applied ML]:** Machine learning models for predicting longitudinal mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic
* **[Stat. methods]:** Detecting context-dependent changes in neural encoding from longitudinal electrophysiological recordings
* **[Applied ML]:** 3D pose estimation & unsupervised behavior classification of animals in video
* **[Open science]:** Improving standardization of two-photon and holographic photostimulation archival data formats


## Education

I graduated *magna cum laude* from Dartmouth College in June 2021, with a double major in applied mathematics and neuroscience (high honors) and a minor in economics. I worked on research related to adaptive learning and decision making under uncertainty in [Alireza Soltani's lab](http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/), and on projects related to animal tracking and behavior classification in [Peter Tse's octpus lab](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter/). I was also on the men's [Varsity Lightweight Rowing](https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/rowing) team.
